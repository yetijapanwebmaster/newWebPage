          <p style="text-align:justify;">Hey, hi, hello! My name is Lauren. Your snazzy, dazzle-y, most definitely human, shiny new President of YETI! Originally from the US of A, specifically North Carol<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">ina, I came to Yamanashi straight out of undergrad in 2016. I majored in Global Studies and Japanese at UNC Chapel Hill, and with the power of God and Anime on my side I got my JLPT N1 certification in the summer of 2018. I am *REDACTED* years of age and boy golly, does time fly. Unlike me. I cannot fly. No siree. My hobbies are hiking, rock-climbing, jogging, hot spring connoisseur-ing, and basically anything else that gets me outdoors! I look forward to standing on things that are not meant to be stood on and making important announcements to all of you, as well as getting to know you and your earth-customs, which are also my own customs because I am also a human. Let’s have a great year of YETI fun, and continue to make this community one of the best communities in Japan! :D</span>

This year I’ll be transitioning from yeti outreach to secretary. I’ll be helping our fearless leader Lauren do council stuff, and I’ll also be making a Yeti Corner which will discuss local places, restaurants and events in Yamanashi. I want<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> people to enjoy Yamanashi and learn about all the best places...including the best cake shops. Yum!

I also like to read, sing karaoke, play Super Smash Brothers, and watch Netflix/Youtube. I’m a pretty chill girl that’s down for anything. Let’s be friends!</span>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Hello! Leslie hails from the Southern United States, she travels eagerly and consumes beer regularly. Always seeking a good conversation and a new place to find cheese dogs.

Hobbies include sleeping, dog loving, plant collecting (hoarding?), falling down staircases<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">, sandwich crafting, playing video games until 2am, and trying to get anyone to talk to me about Lord of the Rings.

As first year rep (spy), I’m here for you to question and whine too. I encourage any comments, suggestions, pleas, conversations about Lord of the Rings, or concerns thrown my way and I’ll relay it to the YETI council I’ve infiltrated for the 2019-20 year. I love my Yamanashi community and want to help make everyone’s time here the best it can be. Message me on Facebook anytime, email me, or find me in person. I always have time for you.</span>

You guys know the rest. I came to Japan, found the greatest dog and tried to find the best grade A Ramen Japan had to offer. So now I help everyone else, and build websites<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">, handle accounts and stuff. Just livin’ the best life I can.

And one day this weird thing happened. and I mean, like, really weird. I landed a spot on the YETI council. My Spider-Sense told me to give it a try so here I am now as your friendly new neighborhood WEBmaster. As for my sidekick, Nobunaga, have I mentioned he’s the greatest?</span></p>
