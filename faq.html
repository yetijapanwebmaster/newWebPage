        <h3 id="yamanashi">Where is Yamanashi?</h3>
        <p>Home of the best side of Mt. Fuji, Yamanashi is a beautiful prefecture located to the west of Tokyo by about 2 hours. You can reach the prefecture either by train, car, or from one of the many buses that pass through.
          Its most well known sites include Mt. Fuji and its five lakes, as well as the Minami-Alps and the large city of Kofu. The prefecture is surrounded by mountains so most of the population lives within the Kofu basin.
          In the past, Yamanashi was known for its impenetrable strongholds and strong military. In recent years, people have come to know it for its grapes and wine as well as its peaches and various site seeing spots.
          Yamanashi is also well known for itâ€™s koseki jewelry and inden, deer leather work. It does get cold here in the winter so don't forget to warm up with some warm Hotou soup.</p>
